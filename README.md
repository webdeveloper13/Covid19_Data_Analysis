# Covid19_Data_Analysis
In this project, I have preprocessed and merged datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.

Also, there is another dataset which consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I have merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
